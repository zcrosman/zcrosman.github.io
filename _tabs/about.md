"My name is Zach Crosman and am interested in all thing cybersecurity. 
My passion for cybersecurity leads me to tinker with topics I 
find interesting and to start new projects.

In this blog, I plan to share some of these projects and 
writeups for CTFs on HacktheBox, TryHackMe, VulnHub, 
and any other platforms that have a good challenge."
